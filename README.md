## 📝 Description
MEGA-DOS is a sophisticated Python-based tool designed for educational purposes and authorized penetration testing. It simulates high-volume traffic to test website resilience against DDoS attacks, helping administrators evaluate their infrastructure's robustness.

**⚠️ Important Legal Notice:**  
This tool is strictly for educational purposes and authorized security testing. Unauthorized use against any website or network without explicit permission is illegal and punishable by law.

## 🌟 Features
- **Adaptive Attack Algorithm**: Dynamically adjusts attack intensity based on target response
- **Multiple Attack Vectors**: Supports HTTP GET, POST, HEAD requests with randomized payloads
- **Persistent Connections**: Maintains socket connections for increased efficiency
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides live statistics on request rates and success percentages
- **Target Verification**: Confirms website availability before and during testing
- **User Agent Rotation**: Uses diverse user agents to simulate realistic traffic
- **SSL Support**: Can test both HTTP and HTTPS endpoints

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests
Clone the repository or download the script:
